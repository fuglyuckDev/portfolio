#### **Hero Video**

<Documentation imgSrc={"/images/lbl_hero_new.webp"} />

Due to the client's request, a hero video was the first thing a user would see upon entering the website.

<br />
The client needed a large, eyecatching title with navigation buttons which takes
the user to the most used parts of the website **(Services and events)**.
<br />
The main issue I ran in to was webm **compatibility** with **IOS devices**. Thus,
as you can see in the code snippet below, I added an extra *source* the browser can
fallback to (MP4).
<br />
Along-side this, adding a _Poster_ was another way I can keep the visual fidelity
of the application while also accounting for those with a much slower connection.
<br />
So, for example, an IOS user on slow 3G will see the poster image first, then once
the MP4 video has fully loaded, the MP4 video will play.
<br />
With speed and connectivity in mind, the previous website I created for this client
had a loading issue. On the old website I would simply load the page's content via
a simple JSON import. Since I'm using **Next JS**, this time round I decided to leverage
*getServersideProps()*. This way, the content would load even if the video would
take a while to load on slower connections.
<br />

```js
import React from "react";
import styles from "./Hero.module.scss";
import HeroTitle from "../typography/HeroTitle/HeroTitle";

const Hero = ({ title, button, src }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.heroContainer}>
      <HeroTitle text={title} button={button} />
      <video
        poster="/images/pictures/louby_lou_hero_poster.webp"
        autoPlay
        muted
        loop
        playsInline
        className={styles.video}
      >
        <source src={`${src}.webm`} type="video/webm" />
        <source src={`${src}.mp4`} type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Hero;
```

<br />
<br />
<br />

I added a brightness filter to allow the overlayed title to contrast well. Not only that, when videos are focused, they present an outline.

During development, the best way I could think of to fix this was to remove the outline on focus.

<br />
Now, with a little more experience, I think giving the video class a *'pointer-events:
none'* property, this would completely negate the issue and also stop **accidental
focusing of the element**.
<br />
Take a look at the CSS below:
<br />

```scss
@import "../../styles/global/variables";
.heroContainer {
  height: 100vh;
  width: 100%;
  outline: none;
  z-index: 0;
  display: flex;
}

.video {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
  filter: brightness(70%);
}

.video:focus {
  outline: none;
}
```

<br />

#### **Content Cards**

<Documentation imgSrc={"/images/lbl_card_new.webp"} />

Ah, the content cards. These weren't my biggest hurdle, but they certainly posed a small challenge. The main challenge was alternating which side the description and image should be on.

<br />
The design I created required each card to alternate left right left right. So, to
tackle this, all of the data was stored in an array and was given, inside it's object,
a property *'position: 'left' / 'right'*
<br />
Looking back now, this was a bit of a blunder, as I could have saved time by simply
checking the **index** position of each card, dividing the **index** position by
**2** and checking whether the output was an *Integer* or a *Float*. <br />
**Quite like this:**
<br />

```jsx
const isInt = (n) => {
  if (Number.isInteger(n) === true) {
    return "left";
  } else {
    return "right";
  }
};

// Inside the return for the page:

{
  array.map((item, idx) => (
    <Card
      title={item.name}
      desc={item.desc}
      pos={isInt(idx / 2)}
      img={item.image}
      button
      buttonType={"enquire"}
      key={idx}
      imageAlt={item.imageAlt}
    />
  ));
}
{
  (" ");
}
```

#### **Responsive Design**

<Documentation videoUrl={"/videos/lbl_responsive_events"} />

If you've taken a look at my **Figma** files, and also managed to have a look at the **live website**, you'll see that the design I've made has been closely followed.
The differences you see are the differences proposed by the client who wanted this website designed, programmed, hosted and bug-free **within a month**. Hence why there's some designs in figma that you won't see on the live site.

<br />
So, with that in mind, let's have a little look at how I accomplished this responsivity.
<br />
It all starts with **CSS Variables**. I've personally found that having a variables
CSS file greatly increases productivity. It's also a great way to make your CSS **MUCH**
easier to read when you come back to it in a month or two if the client wants any
updates or changes.
<br />
Having a master source for any colours, font sizes, break points or basically anything
that may want to be re-thought out or changed is a game changer. Want to change the
accent colour? Simply change **one property** in your variables file and boom, the
whole website has a fresh new coat of paint.
<br />

```scss
// _variables.scss

// Typography

$title-large: 96px;
$title-large-mobile: 44px;
$title-small: 65px;
$title-small-mobile: 46px;
$button: 20px;
$button-mobile: 18px;
$body: 18px;
$body-mobile: 16px;

// Fonts
$body-font: "Montserrat", sans-serif;

// Border (for debugging UI)
$border: 1px red solid;

// Colors
$accent-light: #da96e0;
$accent-dark: #cf21ec;
$background-dark: #181318;
$background-light: #281f28;

// Breakpoints
$mobile: 500px;
$tablet: 768px;
$tablet-large: 960px;
$laptop: 1024px;
$laptopL: 1442px;
$desktop: 1080px;

// Example of variables used effectively in break-points

@import "../../styles/global/variables";

.body__Container,
.title__Container {
  margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px;
  width: 90%;
  @media only screen and (min-width: $tablet) {
    width: 80%;
  }
  @media only screen and (min-width: $laptopL) {
    width: 70%;
  }
}
```

<br />

So, developing mobile first, with these **variables**, makes life so much easier when I want to implement break-points.
Does the flex direction need reversing on tablet and above? Put in a breakpoint with _$tablet_ with the reversed _flex-direction_ and you're one step closer to a responsive element!

<br />

So, to put the icing on the cake, I added a _transition: 0.5s_ to the whole application
using the universal selector _(\*)_. Now when switching view, changing resolution
or resizing the window, the website will smoothly fall into place without any jarring
**pop-ins**!

#### **Form Validation**

<Documentation videoUrl={"/videos/lbl_validation_events"} />

<br />

Making sure users put the right information into your forms is a task which can be quite easily overlooked.

<br />

As toxic as it may be, I do like to look at users as 40 year old mothers on their kindle trying to order some food from the takeaway.

<br />

My approach to this issue constitutes to that one scene from jurassic park, you know the one, something about a magic word? Anyway, having users fill a form **incorrectly** makes **data** pretty much **null**.

<br />

Rather than trying to fix and validate any issues during **data generation**, why not fix it at the **source**?

<br />

Taking a look at the events card on the website, you'll find that you'll need: at least 1 adult, at least 1 child and that child's name confirmed before the user can even try to book a ticket. Take a look below on how using _Conditional operators_ I managed to quickly **validate** the form before submission.

<br />

```jsx
// JS
return;
<button
  type="submit"
  className={
    // If the number of adults = 0
    adultCount === 0
      ? styles.button__Greyed
      : // If the number of kids does not = the length of the names array
      childCount !== names.length
      ? styles.button__Greyed
      : // If the number of kids = 0
      childCount === 0
      ? styles.button__Greyed
      : null
  }
>
  BOOK NOW
</button>;
```

<br />

```scss

        // CSS

        .checkout__Container button {
          background: $accent-dark;
          color: $background-dark;
        }

        .button__Greyed {
          background: #858585 !important;
          text-decoration: line-through;
          pointer-events: none;

```

<br />

#### **Sanity CMS**

<Documentation imgSrc={"/images/lbl_sanity.webp"} />

<br />

Since my client isn't in the coding business, I had to create a **user-friendly** way to have them have the ability to add and remove events on the website.

<br />

Originally I thought about making my own login system with authentication, _expressjs_ and _mongoDB_. However, for speed and ease I landed on **sanity studio**.

<br />

Installation was **VERY** easy, from what I remember, all I had to do was install an npm package, create an env file for the key & secret and reference them in _'sanity.cli.js'_.

<br />

The part which took the most time was implementing the output of the **CMS** into the website. To accomplish this, I simply initiated the Sanity client first, then used the Hook _getServerSideProps();_ to grab the data I need from **Sanity**. Then I plugged the output of the _getSSP()_ into my page export function via props to work with from there. I used _getServerSideProps();_ as the page requires fetching the data at request time, rather than using _getStaticProps();_, as this would mean I would have to re-build the project each time I wanted to update the data.

<br />

```jsx
import { createClient } from "next-sanity";

        // Create a client instance to use on the page:
        const client = createClient({
          projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID,
          dataset: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET,
          apiVersion: "2023-08-01",
          useCdn: false,
        });

        export async function getServerSideProps() {
          const eventSanityData = await client.fetch(\` *
          [_type == "events"]\`);
          const eventSanityImage = await client.fetch(
            \` *
          [_type == "sanity.imageAsset"]\`
          );
          return {
            props: {
              eventSanityData,
              eventSanityImage,
            },
          };
        }
```

<br />

#### **SILO, Dynamic Page Generation & SEO**

<Documentation imgSrc={"/images/lbl_silo.webp"} />

Since the client covers a wide range of areas within the North West of the UK, implementing a page for those individual towns to leverage **SEO** regularly (Creating a unique page for each town) would have been a massive, time consuming process which would have caused me to miss the deadline the client set out for me.
To circumvent this, I decided to take a **generative approach** when it came to each page.

<br />

First, I created a large _JSON_ file _locations.json_ filed with each county and their respective towns.

<br />

Secondly, I created a _[locations].js_ file which signifies to **NextJS** that this page file will be dynamic.

<br />

Then, I used _getStaticPaths();_ to read through the _locations.json_ file, find the slugs for each dynamic page.

<br />

I then added _getStaticProps();_ to get the town / county name used to generate the slug to fill the content on the page dynamically.

<br />

This approach allowed me to easily create an **SEO** profile for each page which would then be read by the **SEO** bot and hopefully appear in more searches that the Client's demographic in those areas would search for. To allow the **SEO** bot to notice this page, I had to install the npm package _'next-sitemap'_; This would, once configured properly, build a sitemap post nextjs build phase. Giving this sitemap to googles **URL inspector** allowed each page to be read and understood much faster than without a sitemap.
Since the sitemap is generated at build time, any time a new area is added to the _locations.json_ file, it's own page is generated and added to the sitemap for the **URL inspector** to notice rapidly. Faster generation and faster **SEO**!

<br />

**I love Dynamic Page Generation.**

```jsx
/* Does what is says on the tin, gets static paths, this will be the slug
        that it gets from the dataset in the locations.json file */
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = await locations;
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}

/* This basically gets the data from the static path above (Notice params), 
        then returns that data as a prop to be used in the page's export component*/
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const location = await params.location;
  const pageData = await homeData;
  return {
    props: {
      location,
      pageData,
    },
  };
}
```
