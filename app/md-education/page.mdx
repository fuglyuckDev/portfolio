Welcome to the breakdown of the MD Education website, made for MD Education LTD.

This website whas a facet of technology that I will outline in this documentation.

To start, let's have a look at the stack that I'm using in this project:

- Next.js **Front end**
- Next.js **Server**
- PostgreSQL **Database**
- Bunny **CDN**
- Vercel **Hosting**
- byCrypt **Encryption**
- SCSS & SASS **Styling**

**Disclaimer** - The code for this project is quite messy, since I'm the only one working on this project with strict deadlines, I've been unable to refactor & code-review anything.
This is something I will come back to in the future.

<br />
Rather than outlining best practices and other smaller things, let's dive right into
the project. The first place I'd like to look at is the *registration system*. From
my experience, working with a backend framework like **Laravel** would be a much
more secure solution, however, this time round, I used **PostgreSQL**. This was mainly
for speed.
